#### a cool deobfuscator
*this document is copied from [narumii's Deobfuscator](https://github.com/narumii/Deobfuscator/) LOL*

---

### How to use
- Learn **FUCKING JAVA**
- Gain some knowledge of obfuscation/bytecode/re *(~~Optional~~You'd better **FUCKING DO THIS**)*

This deobfuscator does not provide any **gui** or **configuration file** because it's meant to run through an **IDE**.\
To configure deobfuscator for your preferences you need to edit **Loader** class.

### Supported Obfuscators

~~Support your mother, it's just a framework.~~

Actually, it's in development.
- Lemon Obfuscator (idk)
- ***some fucking shit code generators***

---

### Transformers
> If you know nothing bout deobfuscation use **precomposed** ones\
> Most of the transformers are done without frames, so they might not work sometimes

---

~~SandBox doesn't work~~
### WTF i haven't skidded this feature

> ~~Just add `-noverify` to jvm arguments if still doesn't work then open issue~~

> Deobfuscator only makes code readable for humans (don't expect the decompiled jar to run) also if some decompilators can't decompile class try another and if no one works just create issue that includes: `[sample jar with obfuscation, deobfuscator transformers, deobfuscator log file]` and optional obfuscator name.
